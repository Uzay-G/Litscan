# Litscan
This was my first coding project.
It used [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) and the natural language processing lib [spaCy](
). I spent lots of time on it and it taught me the basics of NLP, more intermediate Python and how to setup a webserver although I started with only HTML.

If you can improve it please do and I will review your pull requests but for now the code hasn't been organized and the codebase needs work.
